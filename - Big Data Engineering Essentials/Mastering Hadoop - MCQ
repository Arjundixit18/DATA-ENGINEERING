## QUESTION 1 :- What is the primary role of the NameNode in HDFS?

â—»  Storing data in the form of blocks
â—»  Executing SQL-like queries on big data
âœ… Maintaining metadata and coordinating file operations
â—»  Reducing latency in data processing

## âœ… Correct Answer: Maintaining metadata and coordinating file operations

##ðŸ’¡ Explanation:

## 1. The NameNode is the master node in the HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) architecture. Its primary role is:
## 2. To store metadata about files and directories (like file names, permissions, and block locations).
## 3. To coordinate file system operations, such as opening, closing, renaming files, and managing the DataNodes that store actual data.

## QUESTION 2 :- What is the primary function of DataNodes in HDFS?

âœ… Storing actual data in blocks
â—» Handling client communications
â—» Managing metadata about files
â—» Processing SQL-like queries

## âœ… Correct Answer: Storing actual data in blocks

## ðŸ’¡ Explanation: In HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System):

## 1. DataNodes are the worker nodes.

## 2. Their primary function is to store the actual data in the form of blocks.

## 3. They report back to the NameNode with information about the blocks they store.

## QUESTION 3 :- What is the primary purpose of the MapReduce paradigm in Hadoop?

â—» Data storage
â—» Managing network communication
â—» Real-time analytics
âœ…Parallel data processing

## âœ… Correct Answer: Parallel data processing

##ðŸ’¡ Explanation: The MapReduce paradigm in Hadoop is designed for:

## 1. Parallel processing of large-scale datasets.

## 2. Splitting tasks into smaller sub-tasks (Map phase) and then combining results (Reduce phase).

## 3. Efficiently distributing processing across multiple nodes in a cluster.

## QUESTION 4 :- What are the two main components of MapReduce?

â—» NameNode and DataNodes
âœ…Mapper and Reducer
â—» Combiner and Aggregator
â—» Splitter and Shuffler

## âœ… Correct Answer: Mapper and Reducer

##ðŸ’¡ Explanation: The two main components of the MapReduce programming model are:

## Mapper: Takes input data and processes it to produce intermediate key-value pairs.
## Runs in parallel on different chunks of the data.

## Reducer: Takes intermediate key-value pairs from the Mapper and aggregates or summarizes them to produce the final output.

## QUESTION 5 :- What feature of MapReduce allows it to handle petabytes of data efficiently?
â—» Simplicity
âœ…Scalability through adding more nodes
â—» Batch processing
â—» High 1/0 operations

## âœ… Correct Answer: Scalability through adding more nodes

## ðŸ’¡ Explanation: MapReduce handles petabytes of data efficiently mainly because of its scalability:

## 1. It can distribute tasks across many nodes in a cluster.

## 2. Adding more nodes allows it to process larger datasets in parallel.

## 3. This horizontal scaling is key to handling huge volumes of data.

## QUESTION 6 :- What is the primary role of YARN in the Hadoop ecosystem?

â—» Storing data in blocks across the cluster
â—» Running SQL-like queries on big data
âœ… Managing and allocating resources dynamically across the cluster
â—»  Improving fault tolerance in HDFS

## âœ… Correct Answer: Managing and allocating resources dynamically across the cluster

##ðŸ’¡ Explanation: YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator) is the resource management layer in the Hadoop ecosystem. Its primary role is to:

## 1. Manage and allocate computing resources (CPU, memory) to various applications running on the cluster.

## 2. Schedule jobs and monitor their execution dynamically.


----



----

## QUESTION 7 :- What does YARN use to allocate resources dynamically?

â—» Job scheduling algorithms
âœ…Resource Manager
â—» Application containers
â—» NameNode

##âœ… Correct Answer: Resource Manager

##ðŸ’¡ Explanation: In YARN, the Resource Manager is the central authority responsible for:

## 1. Tracking available cluster resources.

## 2. Allocating resources dynamically to various applications.

## 3. Coordinating with Node Managers on each node to manage containers.


----



----

## QUESTION 8:- What is the primary purpose of application containers in YARN?

âœ…Execute tasks assigned to a node
â—» Allocate resources across the cluster
â—» Monitor the health of nodes
â—» Schedule job execution

## âœ… Correct Answer: Execute tasks assigned to a node

##ðŸ’¡ Explanation: In YARN, application containers are:

## 1.CUnits of work execution where actual tasks run.

## 2. Allocated by the Resource Manager and managed by Node Managers.

## 3. Responsible for running individual components of an application on a specific node.


----

## QUESTION 9 :- Who is responsible for distributing tasks to nodes in the cluster?

â—» NameNode
â—» Node Manager
â—» Application Container
âœ… Resource Manager

## âœ… Correct Answer: Resource Manager

## ðŸ’¡ Explanation: In the YARN architecture:

## 1. The Resource Manager is responsible for allocating resources and distributing tasks to the nodes.

## 2. It works with Node Managers, which manage resources on individual nodes.

## 3. The Application Master negotiates resources with the Resource Manager and monitors the execution.

## QUESTION 10 :- Why is YARN considered scalable?

âœ…It allows for the addition of nodes to handle increased demand.
â—» It uses vertical scaling to improve cluster performance.
â—» It processes data in real time without delays.
â—» It focuses on storing data more effectively.

## âœ… Correct Answer: It allows for the addition of nodes to handle increased demand.

##ðŸ’¡ Explanation: YARN is considered scalable because:

## 1. It supports horizontal scaling, meaning you can add more nodes to the cluster.

## 2. This allows the system to handle increased workloads by distributing tasks across more machines.

## 3.The resource management and scheduling in YARN dynamically allocate resources to applications efficiently, enabling smooth scaling.
