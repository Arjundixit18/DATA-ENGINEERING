## ðŸ›  **What is Hadoop?**

Apache Hadoop is an **open-source framework** for distributed storage and processing of large datasets using **clusters of computers**.

### ðŸ”§ Hadoop Core Components:

1. **HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System):**

   * Stores data across multiple machines.
   * Fault-tolerant and scalable.

2. **YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator):**

   * Manages computing resources and job scheduling.

3. **MapReduce:**

   * Programming model for processing large data in parallel.

4. **Common Utilities:**

   * Java libraries and tools used across Hadoop modules.

## âš¡ What is Apache Spark?

Apache Spark is a **fast, in-memory data processing engine** designed for big data workloads. It supports batch, streaming, machine learning, and graph processing.

### ðŸš€ Spark Core Components:

1. **Spark Core:**

   * Basic functions: task scheduling, memory management, fault recovery.

2. **Spark SQL:**

   * Processes structured data using SQL-like queries.

3. **Spark Streaming:**

   * Real-time data stream processing.

4. **MLlib:**

   * Built-in machine learning algorithms.

5. **GraphX:**

   * Graph computation library.

6. **RDD (Resilient Distributed Datasets):**

   * Immutable distributed collections of objects.

## ðŸ”„ **Hadoop vs Spark Comparison**

| Feature                 | Hadoop                                  | Spark                                          |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Processing Model**    | Batch (MapReduce)                       | Batch + Real-Time (In-Memory)                  |
| **Speed**               | Slower due to disk I/O                  | Faster due to in-memory computing              |
| **Ease of Use**         | Requires Java (verbose)                 | Supports Scala, Python, Java, R                |
| **Data Processing**     | Only batch                              | Batch, streaming, ML, graph                    |
| **Fault Tolerance**     | Yes (replication in HDFS)               | Yes (RDD lineage)                              |
| **Resource Management** | YARN                                    | Can use YARN, Mesos, or Kubernetes             |
| **Streaming Support**   | Limited (via external tools like Storm) | Native (Spark Streaming, Structured Streaming) |
| **ML Support**          | External tools (like Mahout)            | Native (MLlib)                                 |
| **Performance**         | High latency                            | Low latency                                    |

## ðŸ“¦ When to Use What?

* **Use Hadoop MapReduce:**

  * When you're dealing with batch-only jobs.
  * Limited memory and want simple fault-tolerant storage/processing.
* **Use Spark:**

  * When you need fast performance (e.g., iterative ML tasks).
  * Real-time data processing.
  * Interactive data exploration.
