## QUESTION 1 :-  What is the primary purpose of Hadoop?

A. â—»ï¸Ž Real-time data processing
B. âœ… Distributed storage and batch data processing
C. â—»ï¸Ž Streaming data analysis
D. â—»ï¸Ž Graph data analysis

'''
## Correct Answer:  Distributed storage and batch data processing

Explanation: The primary purpose of Hadoop is to:
1. Store large datasets across a distributed file system (HDFS).
2. Process data in batch mode using MapReduce.

## QUESTION 2 :- What is the storage layer in Hadoop called?
â—»ï¸Ž YARN
âœ… HDFS
â—»ï¸Ž MapReduce
â—»ï¸Ž RDDs

## Correct Answer: âœ… HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System)

## QUESTION 3 :- What makes Spark faster than Hadoop for certain tasks?

â—»ï¸Ž Disk-based processing
â—»ï¸Ž Replication of data
â—»ï¸Ž Support for multiple programming languages
âœ… In-memory processing

## âœ… Correct Answer: In-memory processing
## Explanation:
## Apache Spark is faster than Hadoop MapReduce for many tasks because it uses in-memory processing, meaning:
## Intermediate results are stored in RAM, not written to disk after each step.
## This significantly reduces I/O time, especially for iterative tasks like machine learning and graph algorithms.

## QUESTION 4:- What is the primary unit of data processing in Spark ?
â—»ï¸Ž MapReduce jobs
â—»ï¸Ž HDFS blocks
âœ… RDDs (Resilient Distributed Datasets)
â—»ï¸Ž YARN containers

## âœ… Correct Answer: RDDs (Resilient Distributed Datasets)
## Explanation:
## In Apache Spark, the primary unit of data processing is the RDD:
## RDD (Resilient Distributed Dataset) is a fault-tolerant, distributed collection of elements that can be operated on in parallel.
## It supports transformations (like map, filter) and actions (like collect, count).
## RDDs allow in-memory computation, which makes Spark fast.

## QUESTION 5 :- Which feature makes Spark suitable for real-time data processing?

â—»ï¸Ž  MapReduce
âœ… Spark Streaming
â—»ï¸Ž  HDFS replication
â—»ï¸Ž  Fault tolerance

##  âœ… Correct Answer: Spark Streaming

##ðŸ’¡ Explanation:
## Spark Streaming is the feature that enables real-time (streaming) data processing in Apache Spark.
## It allows processing of live data streams from sources like Kafka, Flume, or socket connections.
## Data is processed in micro-batches for near real-time performance.
